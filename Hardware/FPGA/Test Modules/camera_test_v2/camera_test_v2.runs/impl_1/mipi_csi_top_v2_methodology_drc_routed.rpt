TIMING-3#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on Clock Modifying Block  
A primary clock byte_clk is created on the output pin or net mipi_subsystem/mipi_dphy/BUFGCE_DIV_inst/O of a Clock Modifying Block
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks byte_clk and clk_297m_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks byte_clk] -to [get_clocks clk_297m_clk_wiz_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks byte_clk and mutli_pixel_clk_x are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks byte_clk] -to [get_clocks mutli_pixel_clk_x]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#3 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks dphy_clk_i[1] and byte_clk are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks dphy_clk_i[1]] -to [get_clocks byte_clk]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks byte_clk and clk_297m_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks byte_clk] -to [get_clocks clk_297m_clk_wiz_0]
Related violations: <none>

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-51#1 Critical Warning
No common phase between related clocks from parallel CMBs  
The clocks byte_clk and clk_297m_clk_wiz_0 are timed together but have no phase relationship. The design could fail in hardware. The clocks originate from two parallel Clock Modifying Blocks and at least one of the MMCM or PLLs clock dividers is not set to 1. To be safely timed, all MMCMs or PLLs involved in parallel clocking must have the clock divider set to 1.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-51#2 Critical Warning
No common phase between related clocks from parallel CMBs  
The clocks byte_clk and mutli_pixel_clk_x are timed together but have no phase relationship. The design could fail in hardware. The clocks originate from two parallel Clock Modifying Blocks and at least one of the MMCM or PLLs clock dividers is not set to 1.

CLKC-8#1 Advisory
BUFGCE_DIV with active CE or DIVIDE not 1 has BUFG driver  
The BUFGCE_DIV cell pixel_processor/BUFGCE_DIV_PIXEL_CLK pixel_processor/BUFGCE_DIV_PIXEL_CLK/I pin (and CE is ACTIVE or BUFGCE_DIVIDE is not 1) is driven by BUFGCE clock buffer sys_clk_gen/inst/clkout2_buf. It should be reconnected in parallel to the driving clock buffer in order to reduce skew. Cascaded buffers introduce skew that can lead to difficult or impossible timing closure.
Related violations: <none>

CLKC-56#1 Advisory
MMCME4 with global clock driver has no LOC  
The MMCME4_ADV cell sys_clk_gen/inst/mmcme4_adv_inst CLKIN1 or CLKIN2 pin is driven by global Clock buffer(s) BUFG_inst and does not have a LOC constraint. It is recommended to LOC the MMCM and use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint on the net(s) driven by the global Clock buffer(s).
