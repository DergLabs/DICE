2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-2#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock ila_clk is created on an inappropriate pin clk_wiz_0/inst/clkout1_buf/O. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock ila_clk is defined downstream of clock clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks ftdi_clk and ila_clk are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks ftdi_clk] -to [get_clocks ila_clk]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks ftdi_clk and ila_clk are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks ftdi_clk] -to [get_clocks ila_clk]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-8#1 Critical Warning
No common period between related clocks  
The clocks ftdi_clk and ila_clk are found related (timed together) but have no common (expandable) period
Related violations: <none>
