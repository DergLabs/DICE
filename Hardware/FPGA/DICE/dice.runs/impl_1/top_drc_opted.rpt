2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
DPIP-2#1 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP rgb_to_ycrcb/cb_mult_temp0 input rgb_to_ycrcb/cb_mult_temp0/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-2#2 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP rgb_to_ycrcb/cr_mult_temp0 input rgb_to_ycrcb/cr_mult_temp0/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-2#3 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP rgb_to_ycrcb/y_mult_temp0 input rgb_to_ycrcb/y_mult_temp0/B[17:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-2#4 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP rgb_to_ycrcb/y_mult_temp0__0 input rgb_to_ycrcb/y_mult_temp0__0/B[17:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-2#5 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP rgb_to_ycrcb/y_mult_temp1 input rgb_to_ycrcb/y_mult_temp1/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-4#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP rgb_to_ycrcb/cb_mult_temp0 multiplier stage rgb_to_ycrcb/cb_mult_temp0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-4#2 Warning

gen_image_statistics.image_statistics_core/statistics_core_laplacian/dsp_hsum_acum/U0/i_synth/i_synth_option.i_synth_model/opt_8series.i_uniwrap/i_primitive: DSP48E2 is not using the D port (AMULTSEL = A and BMULTSEL = B). For improved power characteristics, set DREG and ADREG to '1', tie CED, CEAD, and RSTD to logic '0'.
