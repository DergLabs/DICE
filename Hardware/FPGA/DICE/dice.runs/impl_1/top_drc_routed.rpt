AVAL-318#1 Warning
DSP_dynamic_PCIN_tieoff_only_on_bottom_sites  
The DSP48E2 gen_image_statistics.image_statistics_core/statistics_core_gradient/dsp_var_msub/U0/i_synth/i_synth_option.i_synth_model/opt_8series.i_uniwrap/i_primitive is not placed on a bottom site of the device, has OPMODE[5:4] driven by active nets (value '01' uses PCIN bus), and ties some or all of its PCIN bus pin(s) to GND, but that connectivity is only available for the bottom DSP site. Care should be taken for the effect on that PCIN if the DSP site below it is used.
Related violations: <none>

AVAL-318#2 Warning
DSP_dynamic_PCIN_tieoff_only_on_bottom_sites  
The DSP48E2 gen_image_statistics.image_statistics_core/statistics_core_laplacian/dsp_var_msub/U0/i_synth/i_synth_option.i_synth_model/opt_8series.i_uniwrap/i_primitive is not placed on a bottom site of the device, has OPMODE[5:4] driven by active nets (value '01' uses PCIN bus), and ties some or all of its PCIN bus pin(s) to GND, but that connectivity is only available for the bottom DSP site. Care should be taken for the effect on that PCIN if the DSP site below it is used.

DPIP-2#1 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP rgb_to_ycrcb/y_temp2 input rgb_to_ycrcb/y_temp2/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-2#2 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP rgb_to_ycrcb/y_temp3 input rgb_to_ycrcb/y_temp3/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-2#3 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP rgb_to_ycrcb/y_temp3__0 input rgb_to_ycrcb/y_temp3__0/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-3#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP rgb_to_ycrcb/cb_temp2 output rgb_to_ycrcb/cb_temp2/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-3#2 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP rgb_to_ycrcb/cr_temp2 output rgb_to_ycrcb/cr_temp2/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-3#3 Warning
PREG Output pipelining

Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.

PREG Output pipelining  
DSP rgb_to_ycrcb/y_temp3__0 output rgb_to_ycrcb/y_temp3__0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.

DPOP-4#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP rgb_to_ycrcb/cb_temp2 multiplier stage rgb_to_ycrcb/cb_temp2/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-4#2 Warning
